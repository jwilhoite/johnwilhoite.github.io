    <p>This paper studies how fluctuations in global risk aversion shape the currency composition of sovereign debt in emerging market economies. Using a multi-country panel, we document that periods of higher risk aversion are associated with a lower share of local currency debt held by foreign investors. To identify the mechanism through which risk aversion affects the share of local currency debt in equilibrium, we develop a small open-economy model with risk averse foreign investors, discretionary monetary policy, and long-maturity sovereign debt. When risk aversion rises, exchange rate and capital-gains premia embedded in local currency bonds increase and the government’s ability to borrow in local currency debt is constrained.</p>
